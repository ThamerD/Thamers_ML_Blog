The exploratory data analysis indicated that venture success within the CDL program is shaped by a complex combination of factors, with no single feature emerging as a dominant predictor of graduation. The diversity of the CDL portfolio, which includes ventures from fields such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing, further contributes to this complexity.

Data quality was identified as a significant limitation. Substantial missingness was observed in self-reported financial metrics, particularly for revenue, funding, and team size, as ventures were often reluctant to disclose sensitive information. In contrast, structured categorical variables—such as sector, geography, and prototype readiness—were found to be more reliable for modeling. Nevertheless, modeling results demonstrated that these structured features alone were insufficient for accurately predicting graduation outcomes, highlighting the continued importance of qualitative assessments in CDL’s decision-making process.

As summarized in @tbl-model-performance, the best-performing prediction model achieved a validation F1 score of 0.372, indicating that accurate prediction of venture graduation remains challenging. The much higher F1 score observed on the training set (0.949) suggests overfitting rather than genuine predictive capability. Attempts to improve generalizability through model tuning and feature selection resulted in only marginal gains. Several factors likely contributed to these limitations. Venture graduation is influenced by numerous unobservable variables that are not captured in the available data. Graduation decisions are made by different mentors, each with their own biases and criteria, for whom no data are available. The dataset is relatively small, with 3,536 rows in the applications dataset, and a large proportion of columns contain missing data. Additionally, the available data are self-reported, raising concerns about accuracy.

Given these constraints, further model optimization was deemed unlikely to yield substantial improvements. As a result, similarity modeling was adopted as an alternative approach to support venture evaluation. This method may offer advantages because it does not rely on the same predictive assumptions as traditional models and can leverage CDL’s qualitative knowledge in conjunction with structured data, enabling a more nuanced assessment of venture characteristics and outcomes.

In addition, survival analysis using the Cox Proportional Hazards Model was implemented to provide insights into venture retention and dropout risk over time. This approach allows for the analysis of time-to-event data (such as graduation) while accounting for covariates including industry, technology stage, and revenue, and can help identify factors influencing the likelihood of graduation at various stages of the program.

All models and analytical pipelines have been delivered in a reproducible format, with the expectation that their performance will improve as more high-quality data become available. At present, the dashboard offers CDL a comprehensive overview of venture characteristics, graduation rates, and dropout risks, supporting data-driven decision-making and strategic support for ventures throughout the program.
