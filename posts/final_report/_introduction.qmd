Creative Destruction Lab (CDL), an established mentorship-driven accelerator program, is a non-profit organization that runs a program focused on supporting early stage science- and technology-based ventures by connecting them with experienced mentors and potential investors, @cdlprogram. However, despite the program’s support, a significant number of ventures do not make it to graduation, defined as completing all four mentorship sessions. Mentors currently determine whether ventures continue or are dropped from the program based on their progress across sessions. This raises an important question: what factors determine whether a venture will succeed in the CDL program? 

Picking on this question, the project focuses on building a data-driven foundation for answering this critical question. To support our modeling and venture profiling efforts, we drew on four key datasets including applications data: self-reported characteristics of ventures at intake (e.g., revenue, IP strategy, problem type), admitted data: internal program-level tags post-selection (e.g., stream, program year, geography), education data: detailing the academic background of founding teams, and Updates data: tracking revenue, funding, and team size across program sessions. In this work, a blend of machine learning  and statistical models are applied (@hallen2020, @jongwoo2023, @lin1989 and @mona2024). Given the modeling limitations resulting from data quality issues and unobserved factors like mentor impressions (@cdlprogram and @nejad2024), pitch quality, or other qualitative signals, our dashboard heavily emphasizes on descriptive analytics and venture similarity comparisons within the dashboard.

The dashboard integrates all the analytical outputs in an interactive way that supports real-time venture profiling. This tool provides $(1)$ granular venture profiling (through filters that let users drill down into individual ventures or specific cohorts, view key metrics like revenue over time, and analyze country-level distributions); $(2)$ cohort comparisons (via dropdowns for session and stream, alongside visuals for graduation rate by Sector and global venture heatmap, which help contextualize venture performance across regions and industries); and $(3)$ survival probability visualizations (which allows users to explore time-to-dropout predictions, highlighting venture-level risk profiles relative to historical patterns). This enables CDL stakeholders to move beyond binary predictions and instead leverage interpretable, data-informed guidance to support venture success across the mentorship lifecycle. CDL and stakeholders with access to the dashboard can use it to benchmark ventures, monitor cohort trends, and make informed decisions about early interventions and program design.

The remainder of this report is organized as follows: $\text{Section 2}$ outlines the data science methods highlighting the modeling techniques, feature engineering, evaluation metrics, and ethical considerations used to address the project’s scientific objectives; $\text{Section 3}$ covers the data product and results presenting our interactive venture profiling tool, summarizes key findings, and reflects on the design choices, use cases, and areas for future improvement and; $\text{Section 4}$ covers the conclusion and recommendations evaluating how well our data product meets the partner’s needs, and provides strategic guidance for potential enhancements and continued application.
