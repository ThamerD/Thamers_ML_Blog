Based on the findings of this project, several recommendations are proposed to strengthen CDLâ€™s venture selection and monitoring processes. First, integrating the similarity modeling framework into mentor matching could enable more relevant pairings, increasing the likelihood of venture success through better aligned guidance. Survival analysis should also be incorporated into ongoing risk monitoring to help identify dropout risks early and support timely interventions. To address data quality challenges, CDL could consider redesigning application forms to standardize key fields particularly those related to financial metrics and make their completion mandatory. Building real-time data pipelines would ensure that dashboards reflect the most current venture metrics, improving the accuracy and timeliness of monitoring. Finally, collecting structured qualitative feedback, including mentor evaluations and founder pitch assessments, would provide additional context to enhance future predictive and comparative analyses.
