Creative Destruction Lab (CDL) is a non-profit startup accelerator that supports early stage science- and technology-based ventures through mentorship, resources, and investor networks to drive growth and commercialization. However, not all ventures that participate in the program graduate successfully. CDL aims to identify the factors contributing to a ventureâ€™s success and failure in the program to improve its selection process and provide better support. Drawing on a rich dataset of over $5,000$ ventures across multiple cohorts, we analyzed various features from four different data sets, including application records, founder education data, admitted venture logs, and longitudinal program updates (e.g., revenue, funding, headcount) to develop predictive models of venture progression. Yet, substantial missing data posed significant challenges in modeling dropout from the program.

This work benchmarked multiple machine learning models, including logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting classifiers, alongside a conventional Cox Proportional Hazards (PH) model. Performance was evaluated using the F1 score for classifiers and the concordance index (C-index) for survival models. Our findings indicate that machine learning models underperformed in predictive power despite advanced tuning due to data quality limitations, including significant missing data and noisy categorical inputs. In the survival analysis, the Cox PH model achieved moderate predictive performance ($C\text{-}\text{index} \approx 0.61$). In addition to modeling, we developed an interactive dashboard to surface descriptive insights: graduation trends by sector and session, cohort-level revenue trajectories, geographic venture distribution, a venture similarity tool for benchmarking new applicants, and feature attribution plots showing top survival-impacting variables through a tornado plot. While predictive power was limited due to data gaps and unmeasured qualitative factors, the dashboard provides an interpretable tool to support evidence-based decision-making for venture selection and monitoring.
