My name is Thamer Aldawood. This blog is where I will share the lessons I learn throughout my ongoing Machine Learning journey.

I have worked as a Business Analyst and Software Engineer for 3+ years, then decided to take on the Master of Data Science program from UBC to expand my knowledge of Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and the mechanisms working behind the scenes that enable them to do the incredible things they do.
